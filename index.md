**My address:** Department of Mathematics, Boise State University, 1900 University Drive, Boise, Idaho 83725

**email:** ukaiser@boisestate.edu

My research interests are in **Geometric topology**. I consider myself a Differential Topologist interested in all problems related to manifolds. These are questions of immersions and embeddings. I am interested in link theory in manifolds and in low dimensions in associated geometric and quantum invariants. I am also interested in all aspects of *Quantum Computing*. Problems I am presently working on: Categorification of invariants of links in 3-manifolds (LMO-invariant); Skein modules; Computation of colored Jones and Kashaev invariants for certain familes of links (joint with [Rama Mishra](https://ramamishrasite.wordpress.com/))
